This home bursts with life, and we wanted to create bold story of colour and pattern that reflected the home owners vibrant personalities. We included a range of bold wallpapers and balanced these with carefully selected paint colours so ensure the finished look was modern and exciting.

Bold lighting married with beautiful furniture creating the perfect balance between period charm and modern style.  The finished scheme created a beautiful family home which reflected the exuberant and fun personalities of its owners.
