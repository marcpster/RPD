description: "We are a design and build co-ordination company offering a comprehensive interior and event design and styling service.
|Based in Farnham Surrey we work primarily across Hampshire Surrey, Sussex and London but will travel to other destinations in the UK and overseas for the right project.
|The business was born out of Rachels passion for design and interiors and her desire to make stylish living accessible to everyone.  Following a successful career in fashion Rachel retrained in interior design.  Combining all of her passions and years of knowledge and experience Rachel set up her own design practice specialising in residential interiors and events for both private clients and developers.
|We offer a fully bespoke service to all our clients and ranging from design only to full project design and build management.  Our services are fully comprehensive and cover all aspects of home design and build taking you from concept to completion.  Helping you transform your home by enhancing its functionality, aesthetic appeal, and aligning it with your lifestyle and taste.
